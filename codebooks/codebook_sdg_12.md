# Goal 12. Sustainable Consumption and Production
**Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 12

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

* Policy on sustainable consumption and production
* Sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources
* Food waste and harvest loss
* Chemical and other waste management*
* Reduce waste - prevent, reduce, recycle and reuse
* Sustainable business practices and reporting
* Sustainable public procurement
* Citizen awareness and lifestyle change
* Sustainable tourism policy and monitoring
* Rationalization of fossil-fuel subsidies

*This is referring to waste from the production of goods or associated processes, not sewage.

### Key terms (non-exhaustive)
sustainable forestry, food waste, harvest loss, resource management, ESG, waste prevention, reduce, reuse, recycle, repair, recovery, consumption, consumerism, awareness, circular economy, life cycle, sustainable manufacturing, consumer awareness, consumer behaviour, attitudes, metal-organic, radioactive, chemical, treatment, mining

### Not to be confused with...

- 6. Clean Water and Sanitation
	- This covers the treatment of human waste in sewage
- 7. Affordable and Clean Energy
	- This covers the deployment of low carbon technology

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 12 they must include the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

### Examples

| Project description                                        | Is Goal 12? |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| New manufacturing process producing less chemical waste    | Yes         |
| Application of low carbon technology in industrial process | No          |
| Treatment of radioactive waste                             | Yes         |
| Treatment of human waste in sewage                         | No          |
| Studying the repair economy                                | Yes         |
| Consumers putting solar panels on houses                   | No          |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to Remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.

**Goal 12. Targets and Indicators**

* Target 12.1: Implement the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries
	* Indicator 12.1.1: Number of countries with sustainable consumption and production (SCP) national action plans or SCP mainstreamed as a priority or a target into national policies
* Target 12.2: By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources
	* Indicator 12.2.1: Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP
* See Metadata : 
	* Indicator 12.2.2: Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP
* Target 12.3: By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses
	* Indicator 12.3.1: (a) Food loss index and (b) food waste index
* Target 12.4: By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment
	* Indicator 12.4.1: Number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on hazardous waste, and other chemicals that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information as required by each relevant agreement
	* Indicator 12.4.2: Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment
* Target 12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse
	* Indicator 12.5.1: National recycling rate, tons of material recycled
* Target 12.6: Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle
	* Indicator 12.6.1: Number of companies publishing sustainability reports
* Target 12.7: Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities
	* Indicator 12.7.1: Number of countries implementing sustainable public procurement policies and action plans
* Target 12.8: By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature
	* Indicator 12.8.1: Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development (including climate change education) are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment
* Target 12.a: Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production
	* Indicator 12.a.1: Amount of support to developing countries on research and development for sustainable consumption and production and environmentally sound technologies
* Target 12.b: Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products
	* Indicator 12.b.1: Number of sustainable tourism strategies or policies and implemented action plans with agreed monitoring and evaluation tools
* Target 12.c: Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities
	* Indicator 12.c.1: Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption) and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels
