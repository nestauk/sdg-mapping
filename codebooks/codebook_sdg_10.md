# Goal 10. Reduced Inequalities
**Reduce inequality within and among countries**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 10

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

* Income growth of low income/wealth population
* Social, economic and political inclusion of all
* Equal opportunities and reduce inequalities of outcome
* Eliminate discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting alternatives
* Fiscal, wage and social protection policies
* Resilient, regulated and monitored global financial markets and institutions
* Representation of developing countries in global decision-making and institutions
* Safe and responsible migration patterns and policies
* Special and differential treatment for developing countries for world trade
* International development assistance and financial flows
* Reduce costs of migrant remittances

*Many projects detail technological developments. This goal is concerned only with those that are deployed in an industrial setting, rather than fundamental R&D.

**As far as possible, this refers to the deployment of low carbon and sustainable technology in the manufacturing process, rather than the products themselves, although we acknowledge that it is not always easy to distinguish the two.

### Labelling Tips

* Many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as this Goal they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

* The documents are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a Goal. That is fine - we are interested work that either contributes to achieving a goal or generates knowledge directly related to the Goal.

* In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).
