# Goal 6. Clean Water and Sanitation
**Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 6

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

- Access to safe and affordable water for all
- Access to sanitation and hygiene for all
- Water quality, pollution reduction and wastewater treatment
- Water recycling and reuse
- Responsible and efficient water use
- Reduce water scarcity
- Integrated and transboundary water management
- Capacity and quality of (inland) water-related ecosystems*
- Cooperation to build WaSH capacity in developing countries
- Involve local communities in water management

*This relates specifically to water in the context of its availability and use for humans

### Labelling Tips

* Many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as this Goal they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

* The documents are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a Goal. That is fine - we are interested work that either contributes to achieving a goal or generates knowledge directly related to the Goal.

* In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).

### Key terms (non-exhaustive) 
water scarcity, water management, sustainable water use, pollution, freshwater, hydrology, aquifers, water consumption, monitoring, water conservation, drought, surface area, forecasting, water quality, remote sensing, water recycling, wastewater, groundwater, water treatment, water recovery, desalination, water demand, heavy metals, contamination, water supply, drinking water, 

### Not to be confused with

- 14. Life Below Water
	- Covers water ecosystems in seas and oceans
- 15. Life on Land
	- Broader health and biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems

### Examples

| Project description                                               | Is Goal 6? |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Reducing industrial pollutants in body of freshwater              | Yes        |
| Study of animal ecosystem in a lake                               | No         |
| Technological developments for desalination plants                | Yes        |
| New use for water in a manufacturing process                      | No         |
| More efficient use of water in a manufacturing process            | Yes        |
| Decrease in capacity of a body of water use for drinking purposes | Yes        |

**Goal 6. Targets and Indicators**

* Target 6.1: By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all
   * Indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services
* Target 6.2: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
	* Indicator 6.2.1: Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water
* Target 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally
	* Indicator 6.3.1: Proportion of wastewater safely treated
	* Indicator 6.3.2: Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality
* Target 6.4: By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity
	* Indicator 6.4.1: Change in water-use efficiency over time
	* Indicator 6.4.2: Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources
* Target 6.5: By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate
	* Indicator 6.5.1: Degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0-100)
	* Indicator 6.5.2: Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation
* Target 6.6: By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes
	* Indicator 6.6.1: Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time
* Target 6.a: By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies
	* Indicator 6.a.1: Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan 
* Target 6.b: Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management
	* Indicator 6.b.1: Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management
