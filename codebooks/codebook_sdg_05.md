# Goal 5. Gender Equality
**Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 5

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

* Discrimination against women and girls*
* Violence against women and girls
* Trafficking and sexual exploitation of women and girls
* Child, early and forced marriage
* Elimination of female genital mutilation
* Recognition and value for unpaid care and domestic work
* Public services, infrastructure and social protection policies for women 
* Shared responsibility within the household and the family
* Women's participation and opportunities in political and economic leadership
* Universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights**
* Rights to economic resources, land and property for women
* Rights to financial services and inheritance rights for women
* ICT and other technology for the empowerment of women
* Policies and legislation for gender equality

*Goal 5 does not refer to people who are transgender, non-binary or intersex, but only to women and girls. For this exercise, we consider LGBT+ rights to be covered in Goal 10. Reduced Inequalities. Depending on the exact identity of the subjects of the research, you may make your best judgement to classify the project. For your own interest, [Stonewall have produced a guide](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/system/files/sdg-guide.pdf) that makes recommendations on enhancing LGBT rights through the SDGs.

**Projects about female health and health conditions _do not_ count towards Goal 5, unless they are specifically about improving _access_ to sexual and reproductive health. Female health issues more broadly are covered by Goal 3. Good Health and Well-being.

### Labelling Tips

* Many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as this Goal they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

* The documents are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a Goal. That is fine - we are interested work that either contributes to achieving a goal or generates knowledge directly related to the Goal.

* In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).
