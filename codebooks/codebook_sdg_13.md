# Goal 13. Climate Action
**Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 13

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

* Climate resilience and adaptation*
* Risk reduction for climate hazards - wildfires, droughts, floods, extreme weather etc.
* Climate mitigation and adaptation policy, strategy and planning
* Education and public awareness on climate mitigation, adaptation, impacts and readiness
* Fund mitigation measures in low-income countries

*We are including climate-related meteorological studies and other works that generate knowledge about modern climate change

### Key terms (non-exhaustive)
extreme weather, temperature, climate change, climate variability, adaptation, climate resilience, atmospheric exchange, meteorology, flood, drought, wildfire, coastal inundation, early warning, forecasting, risk reduction, greenhouse gas budget, nationally determined contribution (NDC), impact assessment, global warming, co2 emissions, projection, sea level rise, climatic causes, ocean acidification

### Not to be confused with...

- 7. Affordable and Clean Energy
	- This covers the general development and deployment of low carbon technology whereas Goal 13 covers policy and other high level decisions

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 13 they must include the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

### Examples

| Project description                                        | Is Goal 13? |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Studies on effectiveness of climate adaptation engineering | Yes         |
| Application of low carbon technology in industrial process | No          |
| National planning for greenhouse gas reduction             | Yes         |
| Fundamental research on new solar cell materials           | No          |
| Modelling climate related changes in the upper atmosphere  | Yes         |
| Measuring the ozone layer                                  | No          |
| High level study of national approach to mitigation        | Yes         |
| New construction methods for nuclear energy                | No          |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to Remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.

**Goal 13. Targets and Indicators**

* Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
	* Indicator 13.1.1: Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population
	* Indicator 13.1.2: Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030
	* Indicator 13.1.3: Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies
* Target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning
	* Indicator 13.2.1: Number of countries that have communicated the establishment or operationalization of an integrated policy/strategy/plan which increases their ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production (including a national adaptation plan, nationally determined contribution, national communication, biennial update report or other)
* Target 13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning
	* Indicator 13.3.1: Number of countries that have integrated mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning into primary, secondary and tertiary curricula
	* Indicator 13.3.2: Number of countries that have communicated the strengthening of institutional, systemic and individual capacity-building to implement adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer, and development actions
* Target 13.a: Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible
	* Indicator 13.a.1: Mobilized amount of United States dollars per year between 2020 and 2025 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment
* Target 13.b: Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities
	* Indicator 13.b.1: Number of least developed countries and small island developing States that are receiving specialized support, and amount of support, including finance, technology and capacity-building, for mechanisms for raising capacities for effective climate change-related planning and management, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities
