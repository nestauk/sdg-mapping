# Goal 3. Good Health and Well-Being
**Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 3

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

- Improving the health of millions
- Increase life expectancy and reduce deaths caused by external factors such as road traffic accidents
- Reduce the global maternal mortality ratio
- Reduce the number deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, and water and soil pollution*
- End the epidemics of diseases and premature deaths caused by such diseases
- Prevention and treatment of substance abuse (incl. tobacco)

- Support of the research and development of vaccines and medicines
- Universal healthcare and universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services*
- Access to health-care services*
- Universal health coverage, health insurance and access to medicines
- Development, training and retention of the health workforce
- Early warning, risk reduction and management of national/international health risks

* There are specific goals for broader gender inequality and other inequalities. Please only label projects `Yes` if they concern equality in a health-specific context.


### Key terms (non-exhaustive)

health, wellbeing, life quality, health risks, prevention, disease, illness, health-related, screening, therapy, disorders, healthcare services, drug discovery, pharmaceutical, cancer, reproductive health, morality rate, welfare

### Not to be confused with

- 10. Reduced Inequalities
  - Access to quality services for all not specifically related to health

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 3 they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

For example:

| Project description                                                                        | Is Goal 3? |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Project discussing new techniques for creating prostheses for deafness                                     | Yes        |
| Project discussing imagining strategies on patients with intermediate risk of coronary artery disease                                    | Yes        |
| Project discussing clot formation as a potential diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease                                     | Yes        |
| Project discussing a early-warning system for agriculture-related diseases such as wheat rust diseases                                    | No         |
| Project discussing metabolic interactions in oceanic photosymbioses                                    | No         |
| Project discussing the effects of chronic pollution by off-shore oil and gas on marine life                                    | No         |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to Remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.
