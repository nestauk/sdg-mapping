# Goal 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
**Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 9

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

* Quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure
* Grow inclusive and sustainable industrialization and manufacturing 
* Industrial SME access to financial services and markets
* Infrastructure upgrades and industry retrofits for  sustainability
* Resource-use efficiency and greater 
* Clean and environmentally safe technologies and industrial processes*
* Enhance scientific research**
* Upgrade the technological capability of industry***
* Diversification to medium and high-tech industries
* Access to ICT and internet

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of these in a significant way.

*As far as possible, this refers to the deployment of low carbon and sustainable technology in industrial processes, rather than the products themselves, although we acknowledge that it is not always easy to distinguish the two.

**There are many projects about training centres for various disciplines. We are mostly interested in centres that relate to science, technology or innovation.

***Many projects describe fundamental technological developments. This goal is concerned only with those that are deployed in an industrial setting, rather than basic R&D.


## Key terms (non-exhaustive)
wireless networks, sustainable production, industry 4.0, 5G, ICT infrastructure, engineering, infrastructure development, manufacturing SMEs, fourth industrial revolution, energy efficient, energy recovery, economic complexity, internet access, centre for excellence, low carbon manufacturing, STEM

### Not to be confused with

- 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth
	- Covers more general economic policies and growth
- 12. Responsible Production and Consumption
	- Covers post-production and consumption based waste and environmental impacts

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 9 they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

### Examples

| Project description                                                    | Is Goal 9? |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Long term investments in electricity grid                              | Yes         |
| Research into new oil refinery designs                                 | No          |
| Industrial method to reduce water and energy use in textile processing | Yes         |
| Development of new type of plant based fabric                          | No          |
| New network for research on Industry 4.0                               | Yes         |
| New training centre for theoretical physics graduates                  | No          |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.

	* Indicator 9.1.2: Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport
* Target 9.2: Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries
	* Indicator 9.2.1: Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita
	* Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment
* Target 9.3: Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets
	* Indicator 9.3.1: Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added
	* Indicator 9.3.2: Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit
* Target 9.4: By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities
	* Indicator 9.4.1: CO2 emission per unit of value added
* Target 9.5: Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending
	* Indicator 9.5.1: Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP
	* Indicator 9.5.2: Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants
