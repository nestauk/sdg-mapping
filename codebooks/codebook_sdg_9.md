# Goal 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
**Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation**

## Labelling Instructions

The key concepts of Goal 9 are:

* Quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure
* Grow inclusive and sustainable industrialization and manufacturing 
* Industrial SME access to financial services and markets
* Infrastructure sustainability and resource use
* Clean and low carbon technology used in industry**
* Enhance scientific research and upgrade the technological capability of industry*
* Supporting infrastructure development
* Diversification to medium and high-tech industries
* Access to ICT and internet

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of these in a significant way.

**Key terms (non-exhaustive):** wireless networks, sustainable production, industry 4.0, 5G, ICT infrastructure, engineering, infrastructure development, manufacturing SMEs, fourth industrial revolution, energy efficient, energy recovery, economic complexity, internet access, centre for excellence, low carbon manufacturing, 

*Many projects detail technological developments. This goal is concerned only with those that are deployed in an industrial setting, rather than fundamental R&D.

**As far as possible, this refers to the deployment of low carbon and sustainable technology in the manufacturing process, rather than the products themselves, although we acknowledge that it is not always easy to distinguish the two.

### Related Goals

There are two Sustainable Development Goals that have aspects that are closely related to Goal 1. These are:

- 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth
	- Covers more general policies 
- 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities
	- Covers urbanisation and all kinds of urban infrastructure
- 12. Responsible Production and Consumption
	- Efficient use of material resources, sustainable products, post-consumption waste management

If a project appears to discuss these Goals (or indeed any others) without mentioning any of the key Goal 2 concepts above, label it with `No`. However, bear in mind that there are projects that do span more than one goal. If the project includes key concepts for Goal 2 as well as issues related to Goals 12, 13 or 15, then please label it with a `Yes`. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

For example:

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### General Labelling Advice

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.

	* Indicator 9.3.1: Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added
	* Indicator 9.3.2: Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit
* Target 9.4: By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities
	* Indicator 9.4.1: CO2 emission per unit of value added
* Target 9.5: Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending
	* Indicator 9.5.1: Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP
	* Indicator 9.5.2: Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants
* Target 9.a: Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States
	* Indicator 9.a.1: Total official international support (official development assistance plus other official flows) to infrastructure
* Target 9.b: Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities
	* Indicator 9.b.1: Proportion of medium and high-tech industry value added in total value added
