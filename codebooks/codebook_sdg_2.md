# Goal 2. Zero Hunger
**End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 2

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

- End hunger
- Access to food for all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations
- Ending all forms of malnutrition
- Agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers
- Access to land, knowledge and technology etc. for farmers
- Sustainable and resilient food production systems
- Climate adaptation in agriculture
- Soil quality
- Maintain diverse agricultural ecosystem including diversity of seeds, plants, genetics etc.
- Agricultural research related to food for human consumption (not biofuels, etc)
- Investment in agricultural and rural infrastructure
- Agricultural trade restrictions and distortions
- Food commodity markets


### Key terms (non-exhaustive)
hunger, world hunger, food, agriculture, malnutrition, farmers, fishers, food production, food producers, food access, nutrition, sufficient food, malnutrition, food systems, famines, starvation, vegetation, minerals, healthy food, vitamins, crop, crop yield, crop production, food commodities, drought, smallholder, genetic resources, soil quality, agricultural practice, seed bank, agricultural markets 

### Not to be confused with


- 12. Responsible Consumption and Production
  - Concerns of extraction and use of resources (environmental, material, natural)
- 13. Climate Action
  - Covers broader impacts of climate change on all land based ecosystems
- 15. Life On Land
  - Sustainable use and protection of ecosystems

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 2 they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

### Examples

| Project description                                                                        | Is Goal 2? |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Project discussing environmental effects on crop yields                        | Yes        |
| Project discussing sustainable production of wheat                                         | Yes        |
| Project discussing the EU's reliance on protein imports                                    | Yes        |
| Project discussing the role of proteins and other molecular structures in cancer and ageing | No         |
| Study measuring the physical capacity of freshwater bodies                                      | No         |
| Project about agricultural resilience to freshwater bodies drying up                                      | Yes         |
| Project discussing the biology of plants and non-agricultural ecosystems                       | No         |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to Remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.

**Goal 2. Targets and Indicators**

- Target 2.1: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round
  - Indicator 2.1.1: Prevalence of undernourishment
  - Indicator 2.1.2: Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)
- Target 2.2: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons
  - Indicator 2.2.1: Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age
  - Indicator 2.2.2: Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age, by type (wasting and overweight)
- Target 2.3: By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment
  - Indicator 2.3.1: Volume of production per labour unit by classes of farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size
  - Indicator 2.3.2: Average income of small-scale food producers, by sex and indigenous status
- Target 2.4: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality
  - Indicator 2.4.1: Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture
- Target 2.5: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed
  - Indicator 2.5.1: Number of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture secured in either medium or long-term conservation facilities
  - Indicator 2.5.2: Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction
- Target 2.a: Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries
  - Indicator 2.a.1: The agriculture orientation index for government expenditures
  - Indicator 2.a.2: Total official flows (official development assistance plus other official flows) to the agriculture sector
