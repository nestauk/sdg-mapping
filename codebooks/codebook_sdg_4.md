# Goal 4. Quality Education
**Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 4

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

- Ensure all children have access to quality and free pre-primary childhood development, care and education.
- Equal access for men and women affordable vocational, technical and tertiary education
- Eliminate gender disparities in access to education and vocational training and for the vulnerable*
- Increase in number of youth and adults who have relevant skills for employment and entrepreneurship
- Achieve literacy and numeracy amongst youth and some adults
- Leaners to acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development such as human rights, gender equality, promotion of cultural diversity, etc*  
- increase the supply of qualified teachers and scholarships available to developing countries

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of these. More detail on the specific targets is provided below.

* There are specific goals for gender, reducing inequalities and gender equality. Please only label projects `Yes` if they mainly relate to these areas in the context of state spending.

### Key terms (non-exhaustive)
education, quality, leaning, school, university, college, academic, vocational, training, education system, literacy, curriculum, STEM, ability, e-book, books, creativity, open learning, student, teacher training, numeracy, access to education

### Not to be confused with

- 5. Gender Equality
  - Concerns gender equality in various areas, not just education (specifically on reproductive health)
- 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth
  - Focus on types of work conditions and improving working environments

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 4 they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

### Examples

| Project description                                                                        | Is Goal 4? |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Project discussing the European infrastructure for open learning                    | Yes        |
| Project discussing the creation of a game which aims to develop and deliver a curriculum in soft skills                    | Yes        |
| Project discussing a collaboration ecosystem enabling EU creative SMEs to exchange multi-media content and create multi-plot, interactive apps for children                   | Yes        |
| Project discussing building capacity for design enabled innovation in urban environments                    | No         |
| Project discussing improving the knowledge of organised crime                    | No         |
| Project discussing research training in a field                    | No         |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to Remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.
