# Goal 15. Life on Land
**Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 15

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

* Conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems 
* Forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands
* Sustainable management of forests
* Deforestation, restoration, afforestation and reforestation
* Combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil
* Land affected by desertification, drought and floods
* Conservation of mountain ecosystems and biodiversity
* Reduce degradation of natural habitats
* Biodiversity loss and threatened species
* Fair and equitable sharing of genetic resource benefits and access*
* Poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna
* Invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems
* Ecosystem and biodiversity in national and local planning and development

*genetic resources refers to "any material of plant, animal, microbial or other origin containing functional units of heredity. Examples include material of plant, animal, or microbial origin, such as medicinal plants, agricultural crops and animal breeds."

### Labelling Tips

* Many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as this Goal they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

* The documents are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a Goal. That is fine - we are interested work that either contributes to achieving a goal or generates knowledge directly related to the Goal.

* In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).

**Goal 15. Targets and Indicators**

* Target 15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements
	* Indicator 15.1.1: Forest area as a proportion of total land area
	* Indicator 15.1.2: Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type
* Target 15.2: By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally
	* Indicator 15.2.1: Progress towards sustainable forest management
* Target 15.3: By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world
	* Indicator 15.3.1: Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area
* Target 15.4: By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development
* Indicator 15.4.1: Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity
	* Indicator 15.4.2: Mountain Green Cover Index
* Target 15.5: Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species
	* Indicator 15.5.1: Red List Index
* Target 15.6: Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed
	* Indicator 15.6.1: Number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits
* Target 15.7: Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products
	* Indicator 15.7.1: Proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked
* Target 15.8: By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species
	* Indicator 15.8.1: Proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species
