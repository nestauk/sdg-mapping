# Goal 1. No Poverty
**End poverty in all its forms everywhere**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 1

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

- Eradicating extreme poverty
- Reducing the number of people living in poverty
- Social protection and welfare systems
- Rights to economic resources such as land, property, technology and financial services
- Economic resilience of the poor and vulnerable to natural, social and economic shocks
- State spending on essential services (education, health and social protection)*
- State spending on sectors that benefit women, the poor and vulnerable*

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of these. More detail on the specific targets is provided below.

*There are specific goals for education, health and gender equality. Please only label projects `Yes` if they mainly relate to these areas in the context of state spending.

### Key terms (non-exhaustive)
poverty reduction, social protection, welfare state, economic justice, low income, quality of life, extreme poverty, economic circumstances, economic crisis, material well-being, property rights, precariousness, poverty, economic exclusion, living standards, disaster resilience, financial inclusion, financial exclusion, social determinants, austerity, poor

### Not to be confused with

- 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth
	- Concerns broader economic development, employment and labour rights
- 10. Reduced Inequalities
	- Covers economic inequality not specifically related to poverty

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 1 they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

### Examples

| Project description                                                | Is Goal 1? |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Project discussing effect of poverty reduction on health outcomes  | Yes        |
| Project discussing welfare systems and the labour market           | Yes        |
| Project discussing labour market but not specifically to benefit the poor           | No        |
| A project relating to the welfare state and inequality             | Yes        |
| A project discussing the history of poverty in a country           | Yes        |
| A project relating to social mobility but not mentioning poverty | No         |
| Project about economic growth but not in the context of poverty    | No         |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to Remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.

**Optional:** You do not need to read this section before labelling the data. It contains the official UN SDG targets for this Goal and are provided for reference. You may want to use them if you are particularly confused by a project.
