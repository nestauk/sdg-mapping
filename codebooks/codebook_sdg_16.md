### Examples

| Project description                                     | Is Goal 16? |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Study on the effect of conflict and violence on poverty | Yes         |
| New road safety measures for self driving cars          | No          |
| Policies on public interest journalism                  | Yes         |
| New ad revenue technologies                             | No          |
| Research on harassment of trade union members           | Yes         |
| Studies of general employment rights                    | No          |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to Remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.
