# Goal 14. Life Below Water
**Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 14

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

* Marine pollution including land-based, marine debris and agricultural*
* Manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems
* Ocean acidification
* Regulate harvesting and end overfishing
* Stop illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing 
* Restore fish stocks
* Marine conservation efforts
* Fishing subsidies
* Small island developing States - economic benefits from marine resources
* Ocean health and marine biodiversity and marine technology**
* Market and marine access for small-scale fishers
* International law regarding seas and oceans

*marine environments in Goal 14 refer to seas and oceans as opposed to lakes, rivers and other land-based or freshwater bodies

**"marine technologies" are technologies developed and used for the safe use, exploitation, protection of, and intervention in, the marine environment

### Labelling Tips

* Many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as this Goal they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

* The documents are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a Goal. That is fine - we are interested work that either contributes to achieving a goal or generates knowledge directly related to the Goal.

* In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).

### Key terms (non-exhaustive)
coastal ecosystems, seas, ocean health, oceanic observation, pollutants, ocean plastic, marine conservation, overfishing, marine health, fish stocks, livelihoods, marine stewardship, ocean biodiversity, blue economy, green shipping, aquaculture, aquatic protein, seafood, microplastics, marine protected area, marine spatial planning, ocean habitats 

### Not to be confused with...

- 6. Clean Water and Sanitation
	- This covers water for human consumption and use
- 15. Life on Land
	- This covers lakes, rivers and other land-based or freshwater bodies

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 14 they must include the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

### Examples

| Project description                                      | Is Goal 14? |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Prevention of pollution in coastal areas                 | Yes         |
| Reducing contaminants in freshwater lakes                | No          |
| Regulation for management of ocean ecosystems            | Yes         |
| New technology for cargo ship capacity                   | No          |
| Oceanography sensing to monitor ocean health             | Yes         |
| Research on tidal or wave energy generation              | No          |
| Economic study of incentives for small scale fishing     | Yes         |
| Impacts of aquaculture (fish farming) on land ecosystems | No          |

**Goal 14. Targets and Indicators**

* Target 14.1: By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution
	* Indicator 14.1.1: Index of coastal eutrophication and floating plastic debris density
* Target 14.2: By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans
	* Indicator 14.2.1: Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches
* Target 14.3: Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels
	* Indicator 14.3.1: Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations
* Target 14.4: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
	* Indicator 14.4.1: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
* Target 14.5: By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information
	* Indicator 14.5.1: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas
* Target 14.6: By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation [c]
	* Indicator 14.6.1: Degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
* Target 14.7: By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism
	* Indicator 14.7.1: Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries
* Target 14.a: Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries
	* Indicator 14.a.1: Proportion of total research budget allocated to research in the field of marine technology
* Target 14.b: Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets
	* Indicator 14.b.1: Degree of application of a legal/regulatory/ policy/institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries
* Target 14.c: Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of "The future we want"
	* Indicator 14.c.1: Number of countries making progress in ratifying, accepting and implementing through legal, policy and institutional frameworks, ocean-related instruments that implement international law, as reflected in the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea, for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources
