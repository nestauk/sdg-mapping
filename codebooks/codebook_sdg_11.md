# Goal 11. Sustainable Cities & Communities
**Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable**

## Labelling Instructions

The key concepts of Goal 11 are:

* Adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services 
* Upgrade slums
* Safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable (public) transport
* Road safety
* Transport accessibility
* Inclusive and sustainable urbanization 
* Participatory, integrated and sustainable urban planning and management
* Protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage
* Protect people, economy and infrastructure against disasters such as floods
* Environmental impacts of cities, e.g. air quality and waste management
* Access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces
* Economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas
* Strengthen national and regional development planning
* City mitigation and adaptation to climate change
* Sustainable and resilient buildings and using local materials

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of these in a significant way.

## Key terms (non-exhaustive)
housing, housing services, running water, sewage systems, public transport, rail network, mass transit, road safety, pedestrians, disabiled access, gentrification, green buildings, environmental planning, participatory planning, local government, cultural heritage, museums, world heritage, landmark, natural landscape, flood protection, earthquake resistant, air pollution, waste management, recycling centres, parks, green space, urban development, rural development, national/regional development planning, climate resilience, carbon emissions, C40 cities, local strategy, low carbon buildings, sustainable architecture, local democracy, participatory, traditional building

### Not to be confused with

- 1. No Poverty
	- Discusses basic social services and economic welfare
- 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
	- Covers industrial resource use and waste from manufacturing
- 12. Responsible Consumption and Production
	- Covers waste and resource use at consumer and industry level

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 11 they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).


### Examples

| Project description                                         | Is Goal 11? |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Impact of homelessness on health                            | Yes         |
| Studies of non-specific welfare programmes                  | No          |
| Creating a new system for controlling bus networks          | Yes         |
| Research focused on electric cars                           | No          |
| Research focused on improving safety of autonomous vehicles | Yes         |
| Study of effects of gentrification                          | Yes         |
| Economic impacts of diversifying industries in a city       | No          |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).


### Things to remember

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.
