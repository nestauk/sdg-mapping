# Goal 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth
**Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all**

## Labelling Instructions

### Key Concepts of Goal 8

To be labelled with `Yes`, a project should explicitly or implicitly refer to at least one of:

* Sustain economic growth 
* Higher economic productivity and diversification
* Decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation*
* Growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises through policy
* Economic resource efficiency and environmental decoupling* * Full, equal and productive employment for all 
* Reduce unemployment through employment, education or training
* Eradicate forced labour, modern slavery, trafficking and child labour (incl. child soldiers)
* Labour rights and safe and secure working environments 
* Migrant labour rights and protection
* Sustainable tourism
* Capacity of domestic financial institutions for financial inclusion
* Aid for Trade

*Projects should relate to these concepts at a high level (e.g. institutional, policy, regional). For example, studies relating to innovative industry clusters or policies aimed at driving creativity and innovation, rather than highly specific inventions or technologies that will be used in industry for productivity or sustainability.

### Example key terms (non-exhaustive)
employee rights, forced labour, trafficking, modern slavery, economic development, economic growth, productivity, creative industries, innovation policy, workers rights, migrant workers, training, employment, youth unemployment, funding access, SMEs, skills, labour markets, unpaid work, job security, precariousness, job seekers, technology transfer, innovation capacity, sustainable tourism, workforce

### Not to be confused with

There are 2 Sustainable Development Goals that have aspects that are closely related to Goal 6. These are: 

- 1. No Poverty
	- Addresses general economic welfare and social protection
- 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
	- Concerns making industry more sustainable
- 10. Reduced Inequalities
	- Addresses general economic welfare and social protection

Remember, many projects will cover more than one Goal, but to be tagged as Goal 8 they must include at least one of the Key Concepts above. Further information on other goals can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/).

### Examples

| Project description                                                   | Is Goal 8? |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Study of policies to enhance innovative practices in SMEs             | Yes        |
| A tech innovation to increase productivity within a specific industry | No         |
| Creating a network of organisations to leverage new technology        | Yes        |
| Tracking forced labour and migrant trafficking                        | Yes        |
| Measuring social cohesion of migrant populations                      | No         |
| Studying the impact of tourism on local ecosystems                    | Yes        |
| Boosting the tourism industry                                         | No         |

In some cases the distinction between `Yes` and `No` will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the `Skip` button (although it is best to try to make a decision).

### General Labelling Advice

The documents that we are labelling are research projects so it may not be clear whether they actually contribute to achieving a goal. That is fine - we are interested in knowing whether work is closely related to the goal, contributes knowledge to understanding the concepts of the goal, or If it satisfies any of these, please label it with `Yes`.
